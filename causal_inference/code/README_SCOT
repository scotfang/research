I've re-written Amy's code using an equivalent semi-hidden markov model
formulation. My code is contained in fluent_models.py, transition_models.py, 
and scot_demo.py.  You should read the code in that order.

For inference I still need to add a viterbi algorithm, which should be 
straightforward to implement, it is same formulation for an HMM except we 
must also account for the state duration of each event which will affect our
transition probability function.
